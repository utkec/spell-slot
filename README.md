# spell-slot
Spell Slot is an application for quick lookup of Dungeons and Dragons' spells that are available in the SRD. There are better options out there such as D&D Beyond, but this is mainly to teach myself Swift. If anyone would like to help by either cleaning up code or helping with new features that would be great. Just make sure to comment your code well enough so I can learn from it. :)
