# spell-slot
### Description
Spell Slot is an application for quick lookup of Dungeons and Dragons' spells that are available in the SRD (I would love to add other spells but that would most likely cause legal issues). There are better options out there such as D&D Beyond, but this is mainly to teach myself Swift. If anyone would like to help by either cleaning up code or helping with new features that would be great. Just make sure to comment your code well enough so I can learn from it. :)

### Installtion
You should just be able to fork the project and open it up in xcode

### Usage
As of right now, simply use the search bar to search for a specific spell and then click on that spell to get more details on it.
